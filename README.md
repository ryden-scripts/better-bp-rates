# Better BP rates

Greasemonkey / Tampermonkey user script for Orpheus Network.

In the current setup, the daily BP rates represent the daily BP rates that you will have in a day from now. Same for weekly, monthly and yearly. For yearly rates, it will display the yearly income in a year from now.
This can be quite confusing, as what you want is either the current yearly rate or the hourly rate in a year from now.

This script separates these values by adding a dropdown where you can select when do you want to see the rates from: Now, In a day, In a week, In a month or In a year.
